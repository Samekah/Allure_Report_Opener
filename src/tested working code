Arguments explained:

"taskkill": This is a Windows command used to terminate tasks/processes by their name or process ID.
"/F": This flag forces the termination of the specified process, essentially meaning "forcefully kill the process."
"/IM": This flag specifies that the following argument is the image name of the process to be terminated.
"cmd.exe": This is the process name that taskkill will try to terminate. cmd.exe represents the Windows Command Prompt.
.start(): This starts the Process by invoking the command specified in the ProcessBuilder. In this case, it triggers the execution of taskkill to terminate all instances of cmd.exe.
